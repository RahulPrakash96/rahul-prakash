# How to Add Images to Your Portfolio

## Project Images

Your portfolio expects these images for projects:
- `project1.png` - 800x450 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- `project2.png` - 800x450 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- `project3.png` - 800x450 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- `project4.png` - 800x450 pixels (16:9 ratio)

### Option 1: Use Your Own Images
Take screenshots of your projects or create custom graphics.

### Option 2: Use Placeholder Images (Quick Start)
Download these placeholder images by visiting these URLs in your browser:

1. **Project 1**: `https://placehold.co/800x450/149ddd/white?text=Project+1`
   - Right-click → Save Image As → `project1.png`

2. **Project 2**: `https://placehold.co/800x450/149ddd/white?text=Project+2`
   - Right-click → Save Image As → `project2.png`

3. **Project 3**: `https://placehold.co/800x450/149ddd/white?text=Project+3`
   - Right-click → Save Image As → `project3.png`

4. **Project 4**: `https://placehold.co/800x450/149ddd/white?text=Project+4`
   - Right-click → Save Image As → `project4.png`

## Certification Icon

Add a certification icon: `cert-icon.png` - 80x80 pixels

**Placeholder**: `https://placehold.co/80x80/149ddd/white?text=CERT`
- Right-click → Save Image As → `cert-icon.png`

### Option 3: Skip Images Temporarily
If you want to launch without images, you can:
1. Remove the `<img>` tag from project cards in `index.html`
2. Or leave them and add images later
